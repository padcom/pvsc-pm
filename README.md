This package is a set of very simple, but powerful tools to help me be more productive with VSCode.

`Ctrl+UpArrow` - scroll screen down and move cursor one line up
`Ctrl+DownArrow` - scroll screen up and move cursor one line down

The effect is that wherever the cursor was on the screen it stays there. That helps me keep focus on the task at hand.
